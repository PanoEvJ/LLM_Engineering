        "1. Find, or create, a pretrained model. This can be instruct-tuned, or not, the options are overwhelmingly endless here!\n",
        "2. Collect Human Feedback for a specific task or collection of tasks.\n",
        "3. Train a \"preference\" or \"reward\" model using the collected human feedback data. The key insight here is that the reward model should output a *scalar* (single number, essentially) value in order to be integrated fully with existing RL strategies.\n",
