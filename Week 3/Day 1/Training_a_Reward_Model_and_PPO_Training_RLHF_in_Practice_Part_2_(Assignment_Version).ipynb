        "1. Find, or create, a pretrained model. This can be instruct-tuned, or not, the options are overwhelmingly endless here!\n",
        "2. Collect Human Feedback for a specific task or collection of tasks.\n",
        "3. Train a \"preference\" or \"reward\" model using the collected human feedback data. The key insight here is that the reward model should output a *scalar* (single number, essentially) value in order to be integrated fully with existing RL strategies.\n",

        ">Fine-tuning a language model via PPO consists of roughly three steps:\n",
        ">\n",
        "> 🗣 **Rollout:** The language model generates a response or continuation based on query which could be the start of a sentence.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> 🧪 **Evaluation:** The query and response are evaluated with a function, model, human feedback or some combination of them. The important thing is that this process should yield a scalar value for each query/response pair.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> 💻 **Optimization:** This is the most complex part. In the optimisation step the query/response pairs are used to calculate the log-probabilities of the tokens in the sequences. This is done with the model that is trained and a reference model, which is usually the pre-trained model before fine-tuning. The KL-divergence between the two outputs is used as an additional reward signal to make sure the generated responses don't deviate too far from the reference language model. The active language model is then trained with PPO.\n",

        "This is all a lot of text that can be boiled down to the following idea:\n",

        "1. Generate tokens that could complete the sequences\n",
        "2. Check the scores of those tokens with our Reward Model\n",
