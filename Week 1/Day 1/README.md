# Creating and Training a Encoder-Decoder Style Model (from Attention is All You Need) From Scratch

In the provided notebook, we'll be working through an example of how we can create, and then train, the original Transformer from the [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) paper

## Build 🏗️

We will build a Transformer Model from Scratch!
