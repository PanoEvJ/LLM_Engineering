# Generative Supervised Fine-tuning of GPT-2

Today we'll be working through a notebook focused on fine-tuning GPT-2 to get better at SQL generation!

## Build 🏗️

We will fine-tune GPT-2 on generating more cohere SQL from a natural language query and a provided context. You can find the notebook in this repository - or by following [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15jVqB30ePvOwkGnumWMdDoVwQfqWgeAC?usp=sharing)

## Ship 🚢

Ship a completed notebook to us! There are a few questions found throughout the notebook that will need to be answered.
